What is "personal information"? For the purposes of this California Privacy Policy, "personal information" is defined as information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California consumer or California household.

III. CCPA RIGHTS FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS
The CCPA provides California consumers with certain rights regarding their personal information. This Section III explains those rights. If you are a California consumer and would like to exercise any of those rights, please see Section III.E (How to Submit a Request) below for more information on how to submit a request.

A. RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT AND ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
If you are a California consumer, you may have the right to request that Toyota provide you with information regarding what personal information about you we have collected, used, disclosed or sold in the preceding twelve (12) months. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will disclose to you the following:

The categories of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding twelve (12) months.
The categories of sources from which we collected your personal information in the preceding twelve (12) months.
The business or commercial purposes for collecting your personal information in the preceding twelve (12) months.
The categories of third parties with whom we shared your personal information in the preceding twelve (12) months.
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you in the preceding twelve (12) months.
B. RIGHT TO DELETE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
If you are a California consumer, you may have the right to request that Toyota delete certain of your personal information that we have collected from you. However, this right to deletion does not apply to any of your personal information that is subject to an exception under the CCPA (as described below). Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information in our records that is not subject to any of the CCPA exceptions. Specifically, we may deny your deletion request if your personal information is required for any of the following reasons, which we will identify in our response to you if we deny your request:

Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
To be able to fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
C. RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THE SALE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
If you are a California consumer, you may have the right to request that Toyota stop selling certain or all of your personal information. Once we receive your request and verify your identity, we will process your request as soon as feasibly possible and will also provide notification of your request to any third parties to whom we sold your personal information in the ninety (90) days prior to your request. You may also use an authorized agent to submit a request to opt-out on your behalf, as long as you provide the authorized agent with written permission to do so and the agent provides such proof to us when they submit your request. If you opt-out and subsequently enter into any transactions where a sale of your personal information is required as a condition of completing the transaction, we will provide you with instructions on how you may opt back in. In addition, your opt-out will not affect any situations where you direct us to transfer your personal information to a third party.

D. RIGHT TO NON-DISCRIMINATION
Toyota will not discriminate against any California consumer who exercises any of the rights described above. Specifically, we will not deny you goods or services; charge you different prices or rates, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; provide you with a different level of service or quality of goods or services; or suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

E. HOW TO SUBMIT A REQUEST
If you are a California consumer and would like to exercise any of the CCPA rights identified above, you may submit a request by either completing the online request form at https://privacy.toyota.com/ or by calling us at 855-226-4048.

F. SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH YOUR AUTHORIZED AGENT
If you are a California consumer, you may have the option to designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf, so long the authorized agent has your written permission to do so and you have taken steps to verify your identity directly with us. If you would like to designate an agent, your agent must register as such with the California Secretary of State and submit a copy of this registration along with your consumer request to us. We may need to contact you directly to verify the request.

G. HOW WE VERIFY YOUR REQUEST
We cannot fulfill your request or provide you with your personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

To verify your identity, we will ask that you provide the following personal information when you submit your request:

First Name
Last Name
Email Address
Mobile Phone Number
Address
City
State
Zip Code
You may need to provide additional information as part of your responses to our identity verification questions. We will only use this information to confirm your identity which may include the use of a third-party identity verification service. In the event we use a third-party identity verification service, our third-party identification verification tool will ask you certain identity verification questions and match those answers with what it has in its database. Depending on your type of request or the information requested by you, we may require additional information in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request.

If we cannot successfully verify your identity, we will inform you of that fact.

We will respond to your request within forty-five (45) days. However, in certain circumstances, we may require additional time to process your request, as permitted by the CCPA or other applicable law. We will advise you within forty-five (45) days after receiving your request if such an extension is necessary and why it is needed. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable consumer request.

If we cannot fulfill your request, our response to you will also explain the reason why we cannot fulfill your request.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know about or access your personal information twice within a 12-month period.
