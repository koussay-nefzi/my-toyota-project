        <h1>Foundation & History</h1>

        <p>As already mentioned, Toyota was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda as a spinoff from his father’s company Toyota
            Industries, so as to manufacture automobiles. Both of these companies now belong to the Toyota Group, one of
            the largest conglomerates globally. Three years before foundation, while Toyota Motor Corporation was still
            part of Toyota Industries, it developed its first product, the Type A engine, as well as its first passenger
            car, the Toyota AA, in 1936.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A milestone in Toyota’s course of action, was the establishment of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. in 1957.
            In the following year the company released the Toyopet sedan, which was its first model to be marketed in
            the United States. Initially, people didn’t think highly of it since it was pricy, and it lacked horsepower.
        </p>
        <h1>Important releases and products</h1>
        <p>In 1958, Toyota released the Land Cruiser, a 4 × 4 utility vehicle which was more successful. In 1965 the
            Toyopet was completely redesigned for American drivers and was released again as the Toyota Corona which
            marked the company’s first major success in the United States.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There was a rapid expansion for the company during the 1960s and ’70s when it began exporting large numbers
            of automobiles to foreign markets. The expansion included acquiring companies such as Hino Motors, Ltd.
            (1966), which is a manufacturer of buses and large trucks, Nippondenso Company, Ltd., an electrical auto
            components maker and Daihitsu Motor Company, Ltd. (1967). The company continued thriving in the U.S market
            as well with a reputation of having low costs, of being fuel-efficient and of having reliable vehicles such
            as the Corolla, which was released in the United States in 1968. All these made Toyota Japan’s largest
            automobile manufacturer for several decades.</p>
        <h1>Brands under Toyota</h1>
        <p>There are five brands under which Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles. These include: the Toyota
            brand, Hino, Lexus, Ranz, and Daihatsu. The company holds a 20.02% share for Subaru Corporation, a 5.1%
            share for Mazda, a 4.9% share for Suzuki, a 4.6% share for Isuzu, a 3.8% share for Yamaha Motor Corporation,
            and a 2.8% share for Panasonic. It also holds stakes in vehicle manufacturing joint-ventures in China (GAC
            Toyota and FAW Toyota), India (Toyota Kirloskar), the Czech Republic (TPCA), the United States (MTMUS).</p>
        <h1>Toyota stock</h1>
        <p>It is worth mentioning that Toyota is listed on the London Stock Exchange under LSE: TYT, on the New York
            Stock Exchange under NYSE: TM and is publicly traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka, Nagoya,
            Fukuoka, and Sapporo exchanges under company code TYO: 7203.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Toyota has been publicly traded in Japan since 1949 and internationally since 1999.</p>
        <h1>Facing Difficulties & Challenges</h1>
        <p>During the second World War the company postponed production of passenger cars and focused on trucks. With
            destroyed facilities and a chaotic economy as the result of World War II, the company did not continue
            making passenger cars until 1947 when the Model SA was introduced.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Three years later, Toyota’s automobile production factories were back on track. The company, in order to gain
            ground and be a solid competitor within the industry, started studying American automobile manufacturers
            because of the common perception of the U.S.’s technical and economic superiority. Toyota executives wanted
            to observe the latest automobile manufacturing technology and in turn implement it in their very own
            facilities to bring increased efficiency immediately.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The company also faced significant financial challenges including the sharp decline of sales due to the
            global financial crisis of 2008 as well as an international safety recall of over 8 million vehicles in
            2010. This temporarily stopped the production and sales of several of its top models.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Also, millions of Toyota vehicles and some other companies were recalled by the American regulators because
            of potentially abnormal functioning airbags produced by the Japanese As stated by the National Highway
            Traffic Safety Administration, the recall was “the largest and most complex safety recall in U.S. history”.
        </p>
        <h1>Toyota in 2021</h1>
        <p>Presently, Toyota owns assembly plants and has distributors in various countries. Besides automotive
            products, its subsidiaries produce rubber and cork materials, steel, synthetic resins, automatic looms, and
            goods made of cotton and wool. Others are involved with real estate, prefabricated housing units, and the
            import and export of raw materials.</p>
